Subdivision List
=================

List of ISO 3166-2 subdivisions with names and ISO codes in many languages and many data formats. Since US state names are among the subdivisions, you can use this list to translate them into a number of languages.

This is an adaptation of [WLM-ISO-3166-2](https://github.com/awjrichards/WLM-ISO-3166-2) by @awjrichards, but in the spirit of [country-list](https://github.com/umpirsky/country-list) by @umpirsky. Because the original data was built using a combination of a commondatahub.com download and Wikipedia API responses, it is only a good guess and surely includes some errors and omissions.

All formats within a language include a master file, which includes all subdivisions avaiable in that language (e.g. `subdivisions.json`), as well as a country file which includes only those subdivisions within that country (e.g. `subdivisions_US.json`).
